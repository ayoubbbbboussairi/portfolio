    description: `Background:
    Automatidata specializes in leveraging client data to craft tailored solutions, ranging from performance dashboards to strategic business insights. Collaborating closely with clients, they transform dormant data into actionable tools that drive efficiency and innovation.
    
    Project Overview:
    In collaboration with the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), Automatidata is tasked with developing a regression model to predict taxi fares prior to rides. The TLC, responsible for licensing and regulating NYC's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles, aims to enhance fare estimation accuracy using data from over 200,000 licensees and approximately one million daily trips.
    
    Tasks at This Stage:
    As the TLC project nears completion, Automatidata focuses on the following tasks:
    
    Determining the optimal modeling approach.
    Constructing a regression model tailored to the project's objectives.
    Finalizing checks on model assumptions to ensure validity.
    Evaluating the model's performance against established metrics.
    Interpreting model outcomes and presenting key findings to TLC stakeholders.
    Note: The dataset utilized in this project is for instructional purposes and may not accurately reflect real-world behavior of NYC taxi riders.`,
